<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time.</p>
<p>While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top.</p>

<ul>
    <li>2 ½ cups warm water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
    <li>7 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
    
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.</li>
    <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.</li>
    
</ol>
